# 🌐 List of free proxy for Telegram (MTProto)

Auto-updated, auto-verified.

This repository is a **fork-focused mirror** of the original project [`SoliSpirit/mtproto`](https://github.com/SoliSpirit/mtproto), with one practical goal:

- keep the original raw proxy feed,
- and provide a more convenient **clickable Markdown list** for daily use.

> **Upstream source:** `SoliSpirit/mtproto`  
> **Sync interval:** every 12 hours

---

## 📦 What this fork provides

This fork keeps **both formats** in sync:

- [`all_proxies.txt`](all_proxies.txt) — original plain text list (one proxy per line)
- [`all_proxies.md`](all_proxies.md) — human-friendly clickable list

So you can choose:

- **automation / scripts** → use `all_proxies.txt`
- **manual usage** (phone/desktop) → use `all_proxies.md`

---

## 🔄 Auto-sync from original project

The repository automatically updates from the original upstream list in `SoliSpirit/mtproto` every 12 hours.

Automation is implemented in:

- `scripts/sync_mtproto.py`
- `.github/workflows/sync-from-solispirit.yml`

---

## 💡 How to use

1. Open [`all_proxies.md`](all_proxies.md)
2. Click any proxy link
3. Telegram will open and suggest enabling that proxy

If needed, you can still copy raw links from [`all_proxies.txt`](all_proxies.txt) and add them manually in Telegram settings.
